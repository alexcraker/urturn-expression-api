<h1>Expression Page</h1>

<p>Your expression as a dedicated page at URL: http://www.urturn.com/username/expression_system_name.</p>

<p>By default this page looks a little bit empty so here is how to improve it.</p>

<h2>Give a title</h2>
<p>Your expression will look great with a title. You just have to define it in your <tt>expression.json</tt> file.

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-javascript">{
  "system_name":"monkey_paradise",
  "version":"1.0.0",
  "title":"Great Monkey Live in Paradise"
}</code></pre>
<h2>Setup the expression banner</h2>

<p>The banner will be displayed on the top of the expression page. To define a banner, add a file 'resources/banner.(png|gig|jpg)' in your expression.</p>
<p>The ideal size of the banner is 500x255 pixels and is always shown with a ratio of this if smaller. Never shown bigger nor stretched.</p>

<h2>Setup the expression icon</h2>

<p>To define an icon, add a file 'resources/icon.(png|gig|jpg)' in your expression.</p>
